# VBA-challenge
In my Submission you should find a vscode file with the code used to find the results in the excel document. 
In the submission you should aslo find a folder containing images of the results obtained with the code.

For the general questions and explinations on certain aspects of vba code I consulted The lecture recording found in canvas as well as chatGpt.

ChatGPT was used mostly for general elaborations on things that might have been rushed during the lectures.

The "lastrow" variable found on line 60 was taken directly from the lectures as we had used it in an example while conducting a student activity as well as the general way to loop through each "ws" found throughout the code.
